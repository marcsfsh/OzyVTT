# Session summary

**Read this when:** you want recent context — what the last few sessions did — without
replaying full chat history. Add a short entry after meaningful work; periodically compress
old entries into `current-state.md` and trim this file.

Newest first. Keep each entry to a few lines: what changed, why, and any follow-up.

## 2026-07-17 — Claude Code tooling upgrade (foundation + scheduled slice)

Stood up the Claude Code tooling layer described in `docs/claude-code-tooling-outline.md`
(a small skill system, not a meta-agent). This session shipped the **foundation + scheduled
slice**:

- `CLAUDE.md` constitutional index (identity, commands, hard rules, context map).
- `docs/ai-context/` — 9 subsystem briefs seeded from a real code survey: product-vision,
  ux-principles, architecture, map-grid, viewer-mode, mobile-ux, realtime, auth-roles,
  testing.
- `docs/ai-ledger/` — current-state, decision-log, known-bugs, this file.
- `.claude/loop.md` — committed default `/loop` operator cadence.
- `.claude/skills/` — the full 9-skill roster: `vtt-task-packet`, `vtt-context-router`,
  `vtt-implement`, `vtt-qa-check`, `vtt-ledger-update`, `vtt-ux-review`, `vtt-test-pass`,
  `vtt-branch-safety`, `vtt-schedule` (the new scheduled-prompts/workflows item). This
  makes the packet → implement → QA → ledger workflow fully live.
- Added the **Scheduled prompts & workflows** section to the outline (key finding:
  session `/loop`/cron are runtime-only; `.claude/loop.md` + GitHub Actions `schedule:` are
  the code-committable pieces).

No application code touched — this is a tooling-only change on
`claude/code-improvements-outline-eqvh9n`.

**Follow-up (remaining outline work):** add the three lifecycle hooks (Stop /
UserPromptSubmit / PreToolUse) in `.claude/settings.json`; optionally add a GitHub Actions
scheduled ledger-drift workflow beside `ci.yml`.

## Before 2026-07-17 (context)
