# Decision log

**Read this when:** you're about to change something that feels architectural, or you're
tempted to re-open a settled question. These are durable decisions — don't relitigate them
without a clear new reason, and if you do change one, record it here with the date and why.

The **canonical architecture record is `docs/adr/`** (19 ADRs). This log captures the
load-bearing decisions in one place plus operating decisions that don't have an ADR.

## Architecture (see `docs/adr/` for full rationale)

- **Authoritative LAN server owns `GameState`.** No game decision runs on the client. (ADR-0001)
- **Realtime protocol:** command → validate → authorize per command → transactional
  execute (receipt + event + projection) → broadcast role-specific projections. Contract
  lives once in `packages/domain`. (ADR-0005)
- **SQLite persistence** with idempotency receipts + revision conflicts; snapshots bound
  replay. Game state only — **auth is separate** (`data/auth.json`). (ADR-0006, ADR-0002)
- **Identity is accountless + LAN-trust.** GM bootstrap is loopback-only; players claim one
  character per browser session; no invitations or cloud accounts. (ADR-0002, ADR-0011)
- **Projection is the security boundary.** Player vs GM views are computed separately;
  players never receive GM-only actors/notes/private rolls/hidden turns. (ADR-0005, ADR-0011)
- **Public integration API reuses the same command/authorization/projection layer — never a
  parallel path** (RISK-004), and the served `openApiDocument` stays byte-identical to
  `packages/api-contract`. (ADR-0016)
- **Full phone+laptop functional parity**, one responsive client, no separate mobile build.
  (ADR-0014, ADR-0001)

## Operating decisions (no ADR)

- **Verification bar:** `check` + `test` + `build` green + live Playwright smoke for UI
  changes, before a PR goes up. (`NEXT-STEPS.md`)
- **Type-checking is the only static gate** — no ESLint/Prettier. Don't assume a linter
  catches style; keep changes idiomatic to surrounding code.
- **Commit/PR hygiene:** never put a raw model id in commits, PR text, or code comments.
- **Branch model:** parallel agents each on their own `claude/*` branch; never touch
  another agent's branch. (`.claude/skills/vtt-branch-safety`)
- **`data/` is local and git-ignored** — never commit campaign data.

## Tooling decisions

- **2026-07-17 — Adopt a small Claude Code skill system** (not a meta-agent) for this repo:
  constitutional `CLAUDE.md` index, modular `docs/ai-context/` briefs, a `docs/ai-ledger/`,
  committed `.claude/loop.md` cadence, and `.claude/skills/`. Rationale and full roadmap in
  `docs/claude-code-tooling-outline.md`. Scheduling that lives in code = `.claude/loop.md` +
  GitHub Actions `schedule:`; session `/loop` and cron tasks are runtime-only.
