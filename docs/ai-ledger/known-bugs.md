## Known gaps

- **[character-builder] Phase-2 gating items found by the requirements QA pass (2026-07-26).** The
  Phase-1 foundation is sound, but three things must land before wizard screens are built:
  1. **`fromCatalog` has no resolver.** Ten catalog slugs are authored on feature choices
     (`fighting-style-feats`, `wizard-spells`, `elf-lineages`, …) with no code or documented convention
     mapping any of them to a query — and the spell-list link is severed on the wire in both directions
     (`ContentSpellSummary` drops `SpellReference.classes`; `ContentClassSummary` drops
     `spellcasting.spellListId`). The first Fighter step and the whole Wizard spell step have no data
     path. Must be resolved **server-side** or the implementer will hand-roll a client-side rules
     decision (violates CLAUDE rule 2).
  2. **Decision 10 (GM picks the allowed ability methods + a custom formula) is modelled nowhere.**
     All four methods' math exists in `packages/rules-5e/src/ability-scores.ts`, but no `GameState`
     field, command, or contract carries the setting. `AbilityScoreAllocator`'s `methods` prop cites
     the decision and is unsupplied.
  3. **Class/species/background wire shapes drop wizard-critical fields** — armor/weapon/tool
     proficiencies, `multiclassPrerequisites`, species `abilityBonuses`, background skill/tool/language
     choices. `ProficienciesSchema` just gained armor/weapons/tools/languages with nothing able to fill
     them.
- **[character-builder] No `ClassReference` → `ClassProgressionTable` adapter.** Every rules function
  accepts an overridable table, but nothing constructs one from bundle data, so a homebrew class falls
  through to SRD defaults **silently**: `d8` hit die, sheet-order stat priority, `casterProgression:
  "none"` (⇒ zero spell slots), ASI at 4/8/12/16, and multiclass prerequisites that always pass. Wrong
  answers, not errors. Highest-value missing piece for homebrew.
- **[character-builder] No feature-rider interpreter.** `FeatureRecord.actions/effects/modifiers/
  grants/uses` are read by nothing but the summary projection, which strips them. `content-library.ts`,
  `packages/domain`, and the published OpenAPI `ContentFeature` description all assert "the server
  applies them when it builds the character" — that code does not exist. Largest unscoped Phase-2 item.
- **[character-builder] `resolveSpellcasting` has zero production consumers.** It is documented as
  mandatory ("so no consumer re-implements it… multiclass support cannot be half-applied"), but
  `apps/client/src/encounter/CharacterSheet.tsx:347-348,548` still computes spell DC/attack and the
  caster label from the top-level `spellcasting.ability` unconditionally — so a multiclass sheet shows
  one DC. Migrate the existing consumer.
- **[character-builder] No server-side builder roll command.** `DiceInputRow` covers manual-entry and
  auto-roll client-side, but nothing server-side accepts a typed builder result the way
  `initiative.roll-self` accepts `natural`. Without it the client owns the roll (violates server
  authority).
- **[character-builder] Homebrew discriminator covers 6 of 9 promised content types.** Spells,
  equipment/weapons/armor, and monsters carry no `source` field, and `EquipmentReferenceSchema.category`
  is a **closed 10-value enum** — a direct conflict with "all item types". Also `SKILL_ABILITY`
  (`CharacterSheet.tsx:33-39`) still hardcodes the 18 SRD skills, there is no `content:skills`
  endpoint, and `skills.v1.json` has no `ability` column, so a homebrew skill needs three edits.
- **[character-builder] Content/test gaps.** `soldier-a` starting equipment references `dice-set` but the
  catalog id is `gaming-set-dice` — invisible because the cross-reference test checks *class* equipment
  ids and *background skill* ids but not background equipment ids. And
  `character-content.test.ts:65-66` sets only `statPriority[0]` to 13, so Paladin/Monk/Ranger
  (multi-ability prerequisites) will fail the moment they are authored.
- **[a11y] `--text-muted` fails AA at small sizes** (3.61:1 dark) — affects `.nh-choice-meta`,
  `.nh-statlist dt` and dozens of app labels. Pre-existing, not introduced by the builder work;
  deliberately not retuned mid-flight. Needs its own pass.

- **[ux] ~~Maps/scenes/encounter IA redesign~~ — RESOLVED 2026-07-22 (scene-centric IA, this PR).**
  The upload → browse → prepare → start experience was rethought scene-first: a new **Scenes** hub tab
  is the prep home (a gallery of scene cards — thumbnail, LIVE/staging badge, go-live, private staging,
  duplicate, drag-reorder, rename, remove); the standalone **Map Setup tab was retired** (its library +
  3×3 calibration fold into the hub via "Manage maps"); **going live also presents the scene's map to
  the shared screen**; and the Encounter tab starts combat on the live scene's map. See
  `docs/product/scene-centric-ia.md` and `session-summary.md` (2026-07-22). Remaining polish (not
  blocking): persisted server thumbnails; the Encounter quick-switch strip could slim further; a
  physical touch-device pass.

- **[mobile] No physical iOS/Android acceptance pass yet** — responsive layout + Pointer
  Events are built and parity is mandated (ADR-0014), but real-device acceptance and a
  degraded-browser fallback UI do not exist. `BUILD_PLAN` GAP-001. Don't claim device
  coverage you haven't actually run.
- **[api] ~~Public API drift~~ — closed 2026-07-18 (PR F on `claude/open-api-core-m75t9d`).**
  EVERY game command is now reachable over `/api/v1` (see `current-state.md`) — combat core plus
  scenes, character claims, token cosmetics, and HTTP player-session issuance. Nothing is
  socket-only anymore; Socket.IO remains the push channel, HTTP the pull/command channel.
- **[api] Credential `gameId` binding is dead plumbing** — `CreateIntegrationCredentialRequest`
  accepts a `gameId`, and `IntegrationCredentialStore.verify` enforces it, but no caller ever
  passes a `gameId` through (`api-v1.ts` / `game-http.ts` wiring), so a credential minted with a
  non-null `gameId` is permanently unusable (generic 403) and `rotate` can't clear it. Predates
  the game API; harmless while everyone leaves it null (this is a single-game product). Either
  thread a real game id through verification or drop the field in a future contract pass.
  Found by architecture review 2026-07-18. **Mitigated 2026-07-18:** the VTT Setup credential
  form no longer offers the field, so the footgun is API-only; the contract keeps accepting it
  for now.

## Gotchas that look like bugs (but aren't)

- **[build] Stale `tsbuildinfo` can mask type errors** — web `check`/`build` are incremental
  (`tsc -b`); a clean `npm run build` resolves confusing results.
- **[auth] Player tokens are not revocable** — only GM sessions have logout/revoke-all; a
  30-day player token stays valid by design. Losing `data/auth.json` or browser storage
  loses GM access/claims with no reset (needs host access).
- **[viewer] Pairing codes are in-memory + single-use** — lost on server restart by design;
  a paired display keeps its persisted token, but new pairings must be re-minted.
- **[maps] Live drag preview can briefly differ from saved geometry** — the client preview
  mirrors server snapping but the server is authoritative; ephemeral annotations
  (measurements ~5s, pings ~4s) rely on a re-broadcast at expiry to resync the viewer.

## How to use this file

Real defects go under **Known gaps** with a suspected cause. If something is working as
designed but surprising, it belongs under **Gotchas** so nobody "fixes" it by accident.
