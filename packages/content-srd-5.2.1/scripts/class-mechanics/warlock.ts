/**
 * Warlock mechanics - the GENERATED half of the overlay for this class and for Fiend Patron.
 *
 * `build-class-bundle.ts` generates this class's prose from the SRD markdown on every run;
 * this overlay is merged on top of it.
 *
 * Stage 4 lane B4. Author here and nowhere else: this file is the only place a Warlock
 * rider, pick, or option mechanic belongs, so two authors working on two classes never touch one
 * file. See `./overlay.ts` for what a `FeatureMechanics` may carry and `./index.ts` for the merge.
